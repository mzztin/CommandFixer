#### Usage of this plugin
The usage of this plugin is quite easy to understand.
If you for example want to execute the command Help it will return `Unknown command. Try /help for a list of commands`, but with this plugin `Help`, `HElp` or any combination with upper or lowercase would work. This counts for every command.
